title: Cannot create new repository
---
<p>The user or <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/robot-accounts.html">robot account</a> does not have permission to create new repositories in this namespace.

<h3 class="reason">I do not belong to an organization and this is not my namespace</h3>
A user can only create repositories in its <b>own</b> namespace. For example, the user <code>devtable</code> can only create repositories named <code>devtable/(repo name)</code>.

<h3 class="reason">I'm trying to use a robot account as my repository's namespace</h3>
A user can only create repositories in its <b>own</b> namespace. Robot accounts cannot create be used as the namespace for repositories.

<h3 class="reason">I'm trying to use a robot account to create a repository</h3>
<p><a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/robot-accounts.html">Robot accounts</a>, despite living under your username or organization name, do not normally possess the ability to create repositories in that namespace for security reasons.</p>

<p>For a user-owned robot account, a repository must be created by the user first, and then permissions granted to the robot account in the repository's <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/repo-admin.html">admin panel</a> to pull and/or push to that repository.</p>

<p>For an organization-owned robot account, a robot account can be granted permission to create repositories if placed under a <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/team.html">team</a> with the <code>creator</code> permission. Otherwise, a robot account must be granted individual permissions.</p>

<h3 class="reason">My account is part of an organization</h3>
Check with your organization administrator to ensure that your user or robot account is part of a <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/teams.html">team</a> with the <code>creator</code> permission.
