title: Cannot create new repository
---
<p>The user or <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/robot-accounts.html">robot account</a> does not have permission to create new repositories in this namespace.

<h3 class="reason">I do not belong to an organization and this is not my namespace</h3>
A user or robot account can only create repositories in its <b>own</b> namespace. For example, the user <code>devtable</code> can only create repositories named <code>devtable/(repo name)</code>.

<h3 class="reason">My account is part of an organization</h3>
Check with your organization administrator to ensure that your user or robot account is part of a <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/teams.html">team</a> with the <code>creator</code> permission.
