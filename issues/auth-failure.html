<p>Attempting to push or pull to.from Quay.io results in a <code>403</code> even after a successful <code>docker login</code></p>


<h3 class="reason">You do not have permission on the repository</h3>
Make sure that your user/robot account/token has permission on the repository. Permissions on a repository can be edited from the <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/repo-admin.html">repository admin panel</a>. Note that if you are trying to push/pull an organization repository, your account must either have permissions OR be a member of a <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/teams.html">team</a>.

<h3 class="reason">You are executing <code>docker</code> in a different environment</h3>
<p>Docker stores the credentials it uses for push and pull in a file typically placed at <code>$HOME/.dockercfg</code>. </p>

<p>If you are executing docker in another environment (scripted <code>docker build</code>, virtual machine, makefile, virtualenv, etc), Docker will not be able to find the <code>.dockercfg</code> file and will fail.</p>

<p><u>Make sure that the <code>.dockercfg</code> is accessible to the environment which is performing the push or pull.</u></p>
