<p>Attempting to push or pull to.from Quay.io results in a <code>403</code> even after a successful <code>docker login</code></p>

<h3 class="reason">You are using Docker version 0.8.1</h3>
<p>Docker 0.8.1 introduced <a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/4267">a bug</a> in its storage of auth credentials in the <code>.dockercfg</code> file that results in no credentials being sent to Quay.io, despite a successful login.</p>

<h4 class="workaround">Workaround</h4>
<p style="padding: 10px; background: #eee; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 10px;">
Note: This workaround may not work 100% of time. If you are still encountering auth issues (especially on <code>push</code>), please downgrade to docker 0.8.0 until we've identified the problem in docker.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Delete your <code>.dockercfg</code> file:
<pre class="command-example">
rm .dockercfg
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Login to Quay.io using the following command which <u>specifies the Quay.io registry path directly</u>:
<pre class="command-example">
docker login https://quay.io/v1/
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3 class="reason">You are executing <code>docker</code> in a different environment</h3>
<p>Docker stores the credentials it uses for push and pull in a file typically placed at <code>$HOME/.dockercfg</code>. </p>

<p>If you are executing docker in another environment (scripted <code>docker build</code>, virtual machine, makefile, virtualenv, etc), Docker will not be able to find the <code>.dockercfg</code> file and will fail.</p>

<p><u>Make sure that the <code>.dockercfg</code> is accessible to the environment which is performing the push or pull.</u></p>

<h3 class="reason">You do not have permission on the repository</h3>
Make sure that your user/robot account/token has permission on the repository. Permissions on a repository can be edited from the <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/repo-admin.html">repository admin panel</a>. Note that if you are trying to push/pull an organization repository, your account must either have permissions OR be a member of a <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/teams.html">team</a>.
