title: Cannot modify repository
---
<p>The user, <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/robot-accounts.html">robot account</a>, or <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/access-token.html">access token</a> does not have permission to modify the repository.</p>

<h3 class="reason">An access token or user does not have at least <code>write</code> permission on the repository</h3>
Check the permissions for the user, robot account or token in the repository's <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/repo-admin.html">admin page</a> and make sure it is listed with <code>write</code> or <code>admin</code>

<h3 class="reason">My account is part of an organization</h3>
Check with your organization administrator to ensure that either your account has <code>write</code> permission or
a <a href="{{ site.domain }}/glossary/teams.html">team</a> in which you are a member has <code>write</code> permission for the repository.
