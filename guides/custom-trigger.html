title: Setting up a Custom Git Trigger
---
<p>
  A Custom Git Trigger is a generic way for any git server to act as a build trigger.<br>
  It relies solely on SSH keys and its webhook endpoint; everything else is left to the user to implement.
</p>

<h3>Creating a Trigger</h3>

<p>Creating a Custom Git Trigger is similar to the creation of any other trigger with a few subtle differences:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is not possible for Quay.io to automatically detect the proper robot account to use with the trigger. This must be done manually in the creation process.</li>
  <li>There are extra steps after the creation of the trigger that must be done in order to use the trigger. These steps are detailed below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Post-creation setup</h3>

<p>Once a trigger has been created, there are 2 additional steps required before the trigger can be used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provide read access to the <b>SSH public key</b> generated when creating the trigger.</li>
  <li>Setup a <b>webhook</b> that POSTs to the Quay.io endpoint to trigger a build.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key and the URL are both available at all times by selecting 'View Credentials' from the gear located in the trigger listing.</p>

<h4>SSH public key access</h4>

<p>Depending on the git server setup, there are various ways to install the SSH public key that Quay.io generates for a custom git trigger. For example, <a href="https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server">the git documentation</a> describes a small server setup in which simply adding the key to <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorize_keys</code> would provide access for builders to clone the repository. For any git repository management software that isn't officially supported, there is usually a location to input the key often labeled as "Deploy Keys".</p>

<h4>Webhook</h4>

<p>In order to automatically trigger a build, one must POST a JSON payload to the webhook URL with the following format:</p>

<pre>
{
  "commit": "1c002dd",                                   // required
  "ref": "refs/heads/master",                            // required
  "default_branch": "master",                            // required
  "commit_info": {                                       // optional
    "url": "gitsoftware.com/repository/commits/1234567", // required
    "message": "initial commit",                         // required
    "date": "timestamp",                                 // required
    "author": {                                          // optional
      "username": "user",                                // required
      "avatar_url": "gravatar.com/user.png",             // required
      "url": "gitsoftware.com/users/user"                // required
    },
    "committer": {                                       // optional
      "username": "user",                                // required
      "avatar_url": "gravatar.com/user.png",             // required
      "url": "gitsoftware.com/users/user"                // required
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Once again, this can be accomplished various ways depending on the server setup, but for most cases can be done via a <a href="https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#idp26374144">post-receive git hook</a>.</p>
