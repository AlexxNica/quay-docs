Organizations provide a way of sharing repositories under a common namespace that does not belong to a single user, but rather to many users in a shared setting (such as a company).

### Creating an organization

To create an organization in the Quay.io UI, click the `+` icon in the top right of the header on any Quay.io page, and choose 'New Organization'.

### Teams

Organizations are organized into a set of [Teams](glossary/teams.html) which provide access to a subset of the repositories under that namespace

### Managing an organization

An organization can be managed by clicking on the organization's name on the landing page once logged in. If you are a member of the Admin team for the organization, additional tabs will appear including _Billing_, _Robot Accounts_, _Logs_ and _Settings_.
