<p>
  There are many circumstances where permissions for repositories need to be shared across those repositories (continuous integration, etc).
  To support this case, Quay allows the use of <b>robot accounts</b> which can be shared by multiple repositories that are owned by a user or organization.
</p>

<h3>Managing robot accounts</h3>
Robot accounts can be managed in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/user-admin.html">user</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/org-admin.html">organization</a>'s admin panel under the <b>Robot Accounts</b> tab.

<h3>Adding a robot account</h3>
Click "Create Robot Account" and enter a name for the account. The username will become <b>namespace+accountname</b> where "namespace" is the name of the user or organiaztion.

<h3>Logging in with a robot account</h3>
The following credentials are used:
<dl>
  <dt>Username</dt><dd>namespace+accountname (Example: mycompany+deploy)</dd>
  <dt>Password</dt><dd>(token value can be found by clicking on the robot account in the admin panel)</dd>
  <dt>Email</dt><dd>This value is ignored, any value may be used.</dd>
</dl>

<pre class="command-example">
docker login quay.io
Login against server at https://quay.io/v1/
Username: mycompany+myrobot
Password: (password from robots panel)
Email: any@example.com
</pre>

<h3>Setting permissions</h3>
Permissions can be granted to a robot account in a repository by adding that account like any other user or team.

<h3>Deleting a robot account</h3>
A robot account can be deleted by clicking the <b><i class="fa fa-times"></i></b> icon and then clicking <b>Delete</b>
